You may waive this right by not having children, or sending a notarized letter with a self-addressed stamped envelope for the receipt to:\n\nApplication Developer\nPO Box 666666\nBurbank, CA 91523\n\n3. Metadata\n\nBy agreeing to these terms you allow us to sell your metadata to any commercial, non-profit, or governmental entity we want to in order to pay our bills.

Arbitration\n\nYou agree that any issues arising from the use of this application will be resolved through binding arbitration, with the selection of the arbitrator by the makers of this application. Issues requiring binding arbitration include but are not limited to: Malfunction of the application, leaking of personal data, application causing your phone to become disabled, and/or summoning of Cthulu.\n\nIF YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU DEFINTELY HAVE NOT READ, PLEASE SELECT \"AGREE\" BELOW.";
